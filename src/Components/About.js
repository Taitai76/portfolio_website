      <h1>About Moh</h1>
      <p>
        Based in the vibrant community of Sarasota, Florida, I am a dedicated
        software developer whose journey in the tech industry is marked by a
        blend of academic excellence and self-directed learning. My academic
        foundation was laid at the State College of Florida, where I graduated
        with an A.S. in Computer Programming and Analysis. My passion for deeper
        practical knowledge led me to Flatiron School's Software Development
        Boot Camp, where I refined my skills and discovered an enduring love for
        coding challenges. Beyond the classroom, my relentless pursuit of
        knowledge and self-taught proficiency in various programming languages
        showcase my adaptability and ability to thrive in the ever-evolving tech
        landscapes.<br></br>
        My particular passion lies in web development, where I enjoy turning
        complex problems into beautiful, functional web applications. This
        enthusiasm is underpinned by my ability to adapt quickly, think
        critically to solve problems, and manage time efficiently, ensuring
        projects move forward smoothly and meet their deadlines.<br></br>
        As for my philosophy towards software development, it revolves around
        the belief that technology should make life simpler and more efficient,
        not more complicated. I strive to create software solutions that are
        both innovative and intuitive, ensuring that technology serves as a
        bridge to solving real-world problems rather than a barrier. This
        philosophy fuels my long-term goal of building my own SaaS company,
        where I aim to develop solutions that empower individuals and businesses
        to achieve their fullest potential.<br></br> In everything I do, I bring
        an eagerness to learn and a commitment to excellence. I believe that the
        journey of education is never complete, and I continuously seek out new
        technologies, methodologies, and best practices to stay at the forefront
        of the software development field. My journey is one of constant growth,
        driven by a vision to not only evolve as a developer but also to
        contribute meaningfully to the tech community and beyond.{" "}
